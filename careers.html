            <p><strong>Level requirement:</strong> PhD </p>
            <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</p>
            <p>Account managers are employed by companies that sell products to other entities, stores or businesses and work to build a relationship with them. They specialize in promoting their product to an entity instead of an individual and building a client portfolio. Accounts for a branded company often are for store or business uniforms, which could include service companies, banks and rental car companies. Some wholesale fashion companies sell their products to department stores and have account managers who develop and maintain the corporate relationship.</p>
